📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

A data analytics and machine learning project that identifies customers likely to churn using Python. The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling for real-world business insights.

🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a company’s product or service. Predicting churn helps businesses retain valuable customers by identifying potential churners early and taking proactive actions.

This project analyzes customer data, explores key factors contributing to churn, and builds a predictive model to classify customers as likely to churn or stay.
